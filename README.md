### This is, CS50.

Each weekly problem set tackles specific topics, building intuition from the ground up. Note, week 0 and its problem set were done in Scratch. As I complete each pset, I'll push the code to the repo.

1. C - An Introduction

2. Array - Strings and Ciphers

3. Algorithms - Sort, Search, and Game of Fifteen

### Motivation

While I've done objectively more complex projects than an introductory CS course, I simply never took one in college. This is my opportunity to do so.

Why Harvard's CS50? I don't think I've seen any other public-facing course with such a committed staff. The result is clear given the quality of content and its overall production value. There is so much more to this course than lecture videos and assignments. This is by far the most "college-feeling" MOOC.
